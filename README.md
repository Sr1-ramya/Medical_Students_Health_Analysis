# Medical_Students_Health_Analysis

This repository contains the R code for analyzing a dataset of medical students. The analysis covers data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and statistical exploration of various health-related metrics and demographic information.

->INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this project is to analyze a dataset of medical students to uncover insights into their demographic and health characteristics. The dataset includes attributes such as age, gender, height, weight, blood type, and other health-related metrics like BMI, cholesterol levels, and more.

->DATA CLEANING AND TRANSFORMATION
The analysis begins with loading the dataset, followed by:

1.Viewing the Dataset: Checking the structure, dimensions, and initial rows.
2.Handling Missing Values: Replacing missing values with mean/mode values.
3.Handling Duplicates: Identifying and removing duplicate records.
4.Data Transformation: Converting categorical data to numerical values and normalizing/standardizing numerical data.
5.Outlier Detection: Identifying and addressing outliers in the dataset.


->VISUALIZATION
The dataset was visualized using various plots, including:

1.Histogram of Age: To visualize the age distribution among the students.
2.Gender Distribution: A bar chart to show the distribution of gender.
3.Scatter Plot of Weight vs. Height: To explore the relationship between weight and height.
4.Boxplot of Cholesterol by Diabetes Status: To analyze the distribution of cholesterol levels based on diabetes status.
5.Grouped Bar Charts: For comparative analysis of different health metrics by gender.


->STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The analysis included:

1.Basic Statistics: Calculating means, modes, and standard deviations.
2.Normalization and Standardization: For uniform scaling of data.
3.Mode Calculation: Used for imputation of categorical variables.


->CONCLUSION
This comprehensive analysis provided several insights:

1.Demographic Insights: A balanced gender representation and a diverse age range were observed, reflecting the varied backgrounds of the medical students.

2.Health Insights: The distribution of key health metrics such as BMI, cholesterol, and heart rate provided an overview of the cohort's health status.

3.Data Quality: The process of cleaning and handling missing data ensured the integrity and accuracy of the analysis, with all missing values appropriately handled and outliers managed.

4.Visualization: The visualizations aided in understanding complex relationships and distributions within the data, such as the correlation between height and weight, and the impact of diabetes on cholesterol levels.

These findings not only highlight the importance of data preprocessing but also provide a basis for more targeted health interventions and studies in similar populations.
